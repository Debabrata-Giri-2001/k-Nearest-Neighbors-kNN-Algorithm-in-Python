# üîóMachine Learning with K-nearest neighbors(KNN)

### ***KNN is a non-parametric and lazy learning algorithm. Non-parametric means there is no assumption for underlying data distribution. In other words, the model structure determined from the dataset. This will be very helpful in practice where most of the real world datasets do not follow mathematical theoretical assumptions. Lazy algorithm means it does not need any training data points for model generation. All training data used in the testing phase. This makes training faster and testing phase slower and costlier. Costly testing phase means time and memory. In the worst case, KNN needs more time to scan all data points and scanning all data points will require more memory for storing training data.***

## The kNN algorithm is a supervised machine learning model. That means it predicts a target variable using one or multiple independent variables.

# üîóThe Idea Behind K-Nearest Neighbours Algorithm

### ` Our behavior is shaped by the companions we grew up with. Our parents also shape our personalities in various ways. If you grow up among folks who enjoy sports, it is highly likely that you will end up loving sports. There are of course exceptions. KNN works similarly. `

# üëækNN Is a Nonlinear Learning Algorithm
A second property that makes a big difference in machine learning algorithms is whether or not the models can estimate nonlinear relationships.

Linear models are models that predict using lines or hyperplanes. In the image, the model is depicted as a line drawn between the points. The model y = ax + b is the classical example of a linear model. You can see how a linear model could fit the example data in the following schematic drawing:

### In this picture, the data points are depicted on the left with stars, triangles, and crosses. On the right is a linear model that can separate triangles from non-triangles. The decision is a line. Every point above the line is a non-triangle, and everything below the line is a triangle.


# Drawbacks of kNN
### The real drawback of kNN is its capacity to adapt to highly complex relationships between independent and dependent variables. kNN is less likely to perform well on advanced tasks like **computer vision** and **natural language processing**.

### You can try to push the performance of kNN as far as possible, potentially by adding other techniques from machine learning. In the last part of the tutorial, you‚Äôll look at a technique called bagging, which is a way to improve predictive performances. At a certain point of complexity, though, kNN will probably be less effective than other models regardless of the way it was tuned.
